DART-HttpStatusCodes
====================

HTTP status codes for Dart.

<pre><code>
class HttpStatus {
  /** Status-Code: 0 (Communication with Server failed) */
  static final int HTTP_COMMUNICATION_FAILED = 0;
  static final int HTTP_0_COMMUNICATION_FAILED = 0;
  
  /** HTTP Status-Code: 200 (OK) */<br />
  static final int HTTP_OK = 200;
  static final int HTTP_200_OK = 200;

  /** HTTP Status-Code: 201 (Created) */
  static final int HTTP_CREATED = 201;
  static final int HTTP_201_CREATED = 201;

  ... all the other codes are in the .dart-file
}
</code></pre>

Hope this helps someone.
